  should show the name of the images last updated.

  should show the images updated today (need a date stamp on photo)

  Include the original filename last part only?), so that even without the thumbnail,
  it still means something.

  Have a "Back to Photo Album" instead of cancel.

  Include a date of photo (and accuracy), which persists across uploads

  Get the date from the meta-data of the image

  Allow upload of a zip of images.

Upgrade details
---------------

insert into relationshipType values ( 201, 'friend', null, 201, 201 );

alter table subject add subjectTypeId int;
update subject set subjectTypeId = 1;
alter table subject alter subjectTypeId set default 1;

alter table photo add label varchar(200);
update photo set label=filename;

create table subjectType (
  subjectTypeId int not null auto_increment,
  label varchar( 100 ),

  primary key( subjectTypeId )
);


insert into subjectType values ( 1, 'person' );
insert into subjectType values ( 2, 'animal' );
Hmm, isn't there family, friends and pets???


Change the subject type for the pets and friends


# ---- family ----
create table family (
  familyId int not null auto_increment,
  label varchar( 300 ) not null,
  subLabel varchar( 300 ),
  notes text,

  primary key( familyId )
);

insert into family values ( 1, 'Robinson, Good, Fielke, Smith, Clap etc.', 'Maintained by Nick Robinson and John Fielke', null );

alter table subject add familyId int;
update subject set familyId = 1;


alter table album add familyId int;
update album set familyId = 1;



# ---- notesRule ----
create table notesRule (
  notesRuleId int not null,
  priority int not null,
  label varchar( 30 ),
  pattern varchar( 100 ),
  replacement varchar( 100 ),

  primary key ( notesRuleId )
);

insert into notesRule values ( 1, 53, 'Heading 1', '(?m)^!(.*)$', '<h1>$1</h1>' );
insert into notesRule values ( 2, 52, 'Heading 2', '(?m)^!!(.*)$', '<h2>$1</h2>' );
insert into notesRule values ( 3, 51, 'Heading 3', '(?m)^!!!(.*)$', '<h3>$1</h3>' );

insert into notesRule values ( 4, 40, 'Bold', '__(.*)__', '<b>$1</b>' );
insert into notesRule values ( 5, 40, 'Italics', "''(.*)''", '<i>$1</i>' );
insert into notesRule values ( 6, 40, 'Horizontal Line', '^----$', '<hr/>' );
insert into notesRule values ( 7, 10, 'Blank Line', '(?m)^$', '<br/>' );









TO DO
-----

- highlight the current photo halo

- Events

- upload zip files of photos

- upload multiple images at a time

- Add icons to the "breadcrums", and add those to the index.jsp too.
  change index.jsp to be more welcoming - and invite people to contribute.


BUGS
-----

Ensure the correct family is got. If a photoId is passed, then work it out from that - not the session.

When editing photos via a person, it is still doing next and prev for the album.
(the other page isn't being used).

MODEL
-----

Album
 - albumPhotoId - delete it, or map it correctly.

Subject
 - Link to the default subjectInPhoto using hibernate.


New Features
------------

- Have events, such as "boat party"
  - New menu option from the Home page.
  - Can also get there from a person's halo - it has a list of events that that person is associtated with.
  - An album can be an event too (such as Algarve 2005)
    - Actually, an album can be PART of an event (so mine, and steve's photos are seperate albums, but one event).
  - Perhaps more generic. Allow arbitary "Labels" to be applied to any photo.

  - Use sessions to build an event
    - Start creating (or editing an event), then each picture has a "add to event" tag.

  - Associating a SUBJECT with an EVENT is semi-automatic. The edit page can list all of the
    people in the photos associated with the event. Next to each person, there is a check box
    which decides if the person is associaed with the event.

  - Each attendee can have a "main attendee" status, such as the bride and groom.
  - These should be at the top, in bold.

- Add wiki technology instead of plain text notes.

- Relationships may not be reversable.
  e.g. Bob may want Jane (his ex) on his page, but Jane does not want Bob on her page.

- invite a relative/friend via e-mail to view or create a family tree.
